## **📌 Key Insights & Conclusion**

This dashboard provides a data-driven overview of patient care and operational patterns in a healthcare setting. Some of the key insights include:

High patient satisfaction scores across most departments, with notable variation by specialization.
Readmission causes are primarily linked to chronic condition flare-ups and non-compliance with medication.
Mortality rates are low, with only a few cases marked as deceased.
Payer distribution shows a balanced mix of Medicare, Medicaid, Private, and Self-payers.
Specialization trends reveal that certain departments (e.g., Orthopedics, Psychiatry) have higher readmission rates.
